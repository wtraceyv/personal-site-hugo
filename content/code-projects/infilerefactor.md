# Infile Refactor
Python CLI/GUI tool to find/replace but in multiple files within a file system (resursively)

---

Really nice for when file paths or variable names have changed and you want to fix it in one sweep without relying on an IDE or some other system.

- Python 3
- PySide 6 (**for QT gui**)
