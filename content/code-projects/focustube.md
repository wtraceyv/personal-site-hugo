# focustube
A streamlined YouTube experience in React

---

In order to brush up on my React skills, I decided to make essentially a YouTube clone, but that intends to let the user search only for needed videos, queue them, and watch them without the added distraction of external ads and the recommendation algorithm.

- Written in React
	- Bootstrap, gh-pages, some npm utilities in the background
- Mobile first responsive
- YouTube Data API v3 and IFrame embedded API
- [Live on GitHub pages](https://wtraceyv.github.io/focustube)
