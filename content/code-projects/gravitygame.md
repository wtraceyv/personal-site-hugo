# Gravity Game
A work in progress physics-aware, space-themed FPS in Godot

---

This has been a good opportunity to work with someone else remotely, think about pipeline optimizations/version control, learn new tools, and play more with multiplayer programming. I have implemented simple multiplayer in the Unity engine, but at this point in Godot the only way is to start with RPC calls, which are lower level than built-in replication systems of Unity or Unreal.

- Godot Engine (native RPC calls)
- GDScript
- Collaborative Git
- Blender, Python, Goodle APIs
